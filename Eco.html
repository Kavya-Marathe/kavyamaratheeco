        <h1 style="color:red;">Urban and Rural Poverty</h1>
        <p>
        India’s present urban system includes about 7933 cities and towns of varying population sizes, and many of these cities and towns are included in the massive expansion of urban growth that was registered over the 2001- 2011 decade.
         The United Nations estimates that most population increase in the future will be reported from the urban areas itself –  by 2030, 165 million additional people are expected to be living in urban areas.

Given the present lack of affordable housing, these numbers are anything but reassuring. 
If the causes of urban poverty and the lives of millions of slum-dwellers are to be improved, many changes must be made.
Traditionally, institutional corruption has played a major role in the slow rate of provision of affordable urban housing. Over the past decades, officials at different levels of operation have been known to harass slum dwellers by asking them to pay up for documents they lacked. They also ignored bureaucratic procedures by “justifying” delays in housing provision, forcing them to permanently settle in these unsustainable settlements.

The scale and depth of poverty is underestimated by most governments and international agencies, and this helps underpin ineffective policies. 
This is made worse by the lack of voice for low-income urban dwellers and their lack of influence within governments and aid agencies. 
We are living in what is often described as the "urban century" – most of the world's economy and more than half its population are now in urban areas. 
The world continues to urbanise – and most of the growth in the world's population is in urban areas in low- and middle-income countries.  

Around a billion urban dwellers live in informal settlements, most of which are affected by:<br>

<li>Poor quality, overcrowded housing</li>
<li>Risk of forceful eviction</li>
<li>Lack of safe, readily available, water supplies</li>
<li>Poor provision for sanitation, drainage and solid waste collection</li>
<li>Lack of access to healthcare, emergency services and policing</li>
<li>Difficulty accessing government schools, and</li>
<li>Locations at high risk of disasters and with risk levels increasing because of climate change.</li>
Most definitions and measurements of poverty take none of the above into consideration, as they are based only on income-levels.
 And income-based poverty lines are usually set too low in relation to the costs of food and non-food needs for urban populations.

  Rural women are particularly disadvantaged, both as poor and as women. Women in both rural and urban areas face a higher risk of poverty and more limited economic opportunities than their male counterparts.
   The number of rural women living in extreme poverty rose by about 50 percent over the past twenty years. Women in rural poverty live under the same harsh conditions as their male counterparts, but experience additional cultural and policy biases which undervalue their work in both the informal, and if accessible, formal labor markets.
   The 2009 World Survey states that “women play an active role in agriculture and rural livelihoods as unpaid family labour, independent farmers and wage labour, often without access to land, credit and other productive assets.”

Rural poverty refers to poverty in rural areas, including factors of rural society, rural economy, and political systems that give rise to the poverty found there.
Rural areas, because of their spread-out populations, typically have less well maintained infrastructure and a harder time accessing markets, which tend to be concentrated in population centers.
Rural communities also face disadvantages in terms of legal and social protections, with women and marginalized communities frequently having hard times accessing land, education and other support systems that help with economic development. Several policies have been tested in both developing and developed economies, including rural electrification and access to other technologies such as internet, gender parity, and improved access to credit and income.
In academic studies, Rural poverty is often discussed in conjunction with spatial inequality, which in this context refers to the inequality between urban and rural areas.
Both rural poverty and spatial inequality are global phenomena, but like poverty in general, there are higher rates of rural poverty in developing countries than in developed countries.
